# RV_VR_Dev_iOS_Video_Player_plugin_in_Unity
Initial Start to VR

It is the vision of this project to create an iOS video plugin for Unity Unity3D to be able to play and stream video easily. Ideally, this project will dispay a skeuomorphed video that will be wrapped around a head mounted display (HMD) so that the content can be thought of as occuring around the viewer. This content will engulf the field of view for the viewer and give them the impression that they are somewhere else.

Please consider contributing to my effort. This is a needed piece of the puzzle for VR to become a viable medium for application development on iOS.
